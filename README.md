<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sujoy-saha/next-carhub-app.git
cd next-carhub-app
```

Get all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Set-up configuration:

Create a `.env.local` in the root directory and add the following configuration details.

```bash
NEXT_RAPID_API_KEY = "Replace with your Rapid API Key"
NEXT_RAPID_API_HOST = "Replace with your Rapid API Host"
NEXT_RAPID_API_END_POINT =  "Replace with your Rapid API Endpoint"

NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGIN_API_KEY = "Replace with your Imagin API Key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGIN_END_POINT = "Replace with your Imagin Endpoint"
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
